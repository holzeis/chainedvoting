### User story: As a user I am only available on certain dates only if specific person(s) are also attending on the same date.

Eventually, this results into a chained voting, meaning that specific persons can vote with lent votes, if the vote is within the agreed dates..

### Applied on the blockchain: 

 1. Lending a vote: Available dates & representatives are picked and placed as chaincode onto the blockchain.
 2. Regular voting: When voting for a date the smart contract is evaluated and executed if a lend vote applies.
